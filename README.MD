# Is Donald Trump still famous

This project automates the checking on Google to see if Donald Trump is still
one of the most famous people on the planet.

We do this by using the *Robot framework* and in particular the
*SeleniumLibrary* library. The search key is *"Who is the most famous person
today"*. If we get *"Donald Trump"* on the first page of results, then he is
still famous.
